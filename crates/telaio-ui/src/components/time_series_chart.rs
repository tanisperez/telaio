//! [`TimeSeriesChart`]: a chart of several series over one shared x axis, as in the "performance
//! over time" card of Postino's load test results.
//!
//! The x axis has `N` evenly spaced points (one per second, say). Each series sits on the left or
//! the right y axis, and each axis has its own maximum (the bottom is always 0) and its own tick
//! labels, which the app passes as strings. Series are lines, dashed lines or filled areas, drawn
//! in the order they were added, and `f64::NAN` values are gaps. Reference lines mark a goal.
//!
//! Hovering shows a crosshair at the nearest point, a dot per series and a tooltip card. Pressing
//! and dragging over the plot selects a range of points (a brush), which the app keeps and passes
//! back with [`TimeSeriesChart::selection`]. The hover and the drag in progress are state of the
//! component ([`Window::use_keyed_state`]), and it re-renders only when the nearest point
//! changes, so an idle window does no work. There are no timers and no animation.
//!
//! Colors are never chosen here: series, axis labels and reference lines take the colors the app
//! passes, and the rest comes from [`crate::Palette`]. A series the app wants to hide (a legend
//! toggle) is simply not added.
//!
//! The math (value to y, index to x, x to nearest index, selection, tooltip placement) is in
//! plain functions at the top of the file, unit tested without a window.
